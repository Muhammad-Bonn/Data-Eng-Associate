# Brazilian E-commerce Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

## Overview

This project builds a **Data Warehouse (DWH)** for the famous [Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).  
The goal is to design a full **data pipeline and modeling workflow** that transforms raw CSV data into structured analytical tables, ready for business intelligence and reporting.

The workflow covers all main ETL/ELT stages:

- Importing and cleaning raw CSV data  
- Organizing it into schemas (`raw`, `staging`, `prefact`, and `dwh`)  
- Building **fact** and **dimension** tables following a star-schema model  
- Preparing the dataset for insights on sales, customers, reviews, and performance analytics
